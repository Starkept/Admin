Whitepaper:

There are supercycles and there are kronocycles. There is only one way to know your money is legit. As for the rest of you. Its a game of tag and your it. This kronocycle will only allow X amount of SATs in the liquidity pool. This way the new money pool is legitimate. That means you have to be an accreditted investor. The guys upstairs got this. If you thought Monero was your secret hiding place. Its your loss. Paying taxes is a good thing. It pays for social services we take for granted everyday. This kronocycle is our only means of keeping things in check. A reset is coming, but it's not the world economy. Its dirty money. In the next 3 years everything will be digital. Yes, cash will still exist, but not the way you think. The powers that be need to retake our country. You know the fellas that eat the constitution for breakfast everyday. We are going to ensure this time around we move toward a more perfect union. Say goodbye to corrupition. Only entities that have proven sound financial responsibility will be in charge. If you like free hand outs. You will get them. The rest of us have a higher calling. We will remake the world as we see fit. Something good is in works. I promise you. You will have 2 generations to get your act together. Mother nature has other plans. We are not here to save you. Our role is to keep law and order. In time you will understand. Disregard the second testment. The serpent is subtle. Enough is enough. If you cannot forgive yourself, that is for you to deal with in the next torus. This is a living language. Think of the blockchain as a wishing well, a message in the bottle. Some of you will learn just as I did the answers you seek are within you. I am good and whole-hearted, but there are forces out there that love me for the wrong reasons. That's beyond my control and of your own making. And for your sake don't trust in extraterestials. We really are that special. As for me. I am just a reflection of you. Catch-up it was your power to being with. Now mind your own business. This never happened. Play nice.
